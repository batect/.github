# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent version of Batect, its supporting services and the website are supported with security fixes. Older versions are not
supported.

Sample projects are provided as-is, and while we will endeavour to fix any issues reported, they are intended as educational examples, not
production-ready code.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover or suspect you have discovered a vulnerability, please report it to charles@batect.dev, including `[Batect security]` in the subject line.
Please include a short description of the issue and steps on how to reproduce it.

The issue will be investigated and fixed privately, then disclosed publicly once a fix is available.

Anyone who reports a vulnerability will be acknowledged in the release notes and security advisory.
